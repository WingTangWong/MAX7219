- add some graphic primitives in a separate class (GDI-like) that would use MAX7219 as a display driver
- related to the above, implement spectrum analyzer specifics for bargraph mode (decay, peaks)
- related to the above, implement fonts via providers (dependency injection) for matrix and 7 segment
- add HAL support for shift registers, used when routing LOAD/#CS via one of those
- add SPI arbitrator support
- add support for 14 and 16 -segment mode, add note to README explaining that the number of bytes read when setting is digits/2 in this case
- implement external element controllers, mainly for animations ticked off from loop(). Rotating dash, spinning zero and scanning bargraph come to mind. Blinking cursor (on matrices) also seems like a good candidate.
