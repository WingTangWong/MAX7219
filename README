Arduino MAX7219/7221 Library

Written by Eberhard Fahle in 2007

To the furthest extent that this is legally possible, the fork maintained by 
Radu - Eosif Mihailescu and published here https://github.com/csdexter/MAX7219
is hereby released under the LGPL version 3.
To the furthest extent that this is legally enforceable, the copyright remains

See the example sketches to learn how to use the library in your code.

HARDWARE NOTES:
 * The MAX7219/7221 are 5V I/O driver chips that power their loads from the
   digital 5V rail. This means you will need to find another power supply to
   feed the MAX if you plan to use more than one of them (the power regulator
   on the Uno/Mega can take 1 MAX + a 64 LED matrix, but not more). This also
   means a lot of noise will be induced in the digital domain of your project
   if you don't take appropriate measures by installing the two filtering
   capacitors show in the documentation. This also means level shifters will
   be needed if you want to talk to the MAX from a 3.3V I/O Arduino.
 * Quick connection reference:
   MAX7219/7221 -> Arduino:
     DIN       -> MOSI    (Arduino output)
     CLK       -> SCK     (Arduino output)
     LOAD/#CS  -> SS      (Arduino output)
