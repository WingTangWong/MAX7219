 * version: https://github.com/csdexter/MAX7219/blob/master/README
 *
 * This library is for use with Maxim's MAX7219 and MAX7221 LED driver chips.
 * Austria Micro Systems' AS1100/1106/1107 is a pin-for-pin compatible and is
 * also supported, including its extra functionality in register 0xE.
 * See the example sketches to learn how to use the library in your code.

// Font for 16-segment displays (MAX7219 doesn't have a built-in character
// generator for those). One word per character, one bit per segment, DP is not
// used and you need two MAX7219 digits to drive one 16-segment display digit.
// Mapping goes as follows (digit/segment on MAX7219 => segment on display):
// D0/DP=>A1, D0/A=>A2, D0/B=>B, D0/C=>C, D0/D=>D1, D0/E=>D2, D0/F=>E, D0/G=>F
// D1/DP=>G1, D1/A=>G2, D1/B=>H, D1/C=>I, D1/D=>J, D1/E=>K, D1/F=>L, D1/G=>M
// Font begins with ASCII 0x20, also known as space.
// A1 A2 B  C  D1 D2 E F
// 80 40 20 10 8  4  2 1
