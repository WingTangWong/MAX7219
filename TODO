- add some graphic primitives in a separate class (GDI-like) that would use MAX7219 as a display driver
- related to the above, implement spectrum analyzer specifics for bargraph mode (decay, peaks)
- related to the above, implement fonts via providers (dependency injection) for matrix and 7 segment
- add HAL support (shift register routing for LOAD/#CS) to the code
- add SPI arbitrator support
- add support for 14 and 16 -segment mode, add note to README explaining that the number of bytes read when setting is digits/2 in this case. This further depends on the font provider thing since (1) the MAX doesn't do 14/16 segment decoding, (2) we'll have to do it ourselves and (3) it's no fun building something for just one use.
- implement external element controllers, mainly for animations ticked off from loop(). Rotating dash, spinning zero and scanning bargraph come to mind. Blinking cursor (on matrices) also seems like a good candidate.
